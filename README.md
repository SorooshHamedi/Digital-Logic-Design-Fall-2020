# Digital-Logic-Design-Fall-2020

Digital Circuit design using VHDL

Description of all CA's available in pdf format in the corresponding folders.

CA1: Implementation of Bit Compare Slice, circuit comparing two bits in Verilog. 

CA2: Implementation of 8 bit comparator using 4 Two Bit Compare Slices

CA3: The goal is to implement N bit Incrementor. During the step by step implementation the following circuits are developed

      1.n-bit comparator
      
      2.Two bit Multiplexer-based Adder
      
      3.N bit Multiplexer-based Adder
      
      3.Two bit Multiplexer-based Incrementor
      
      4.B bit Multiplexer-based Incrementor
